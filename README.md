# Coffee Machine

This is a simple project to learn Java syntax and basic OOP theory. Just one source file and one class (CoffeeMachine).

It simulates a coffee machine and provides 3 different types of drinks to the user (espresso, latte and cappuccino). Each kind of drink needs a specific amount of resources (water, milk, beans and cups) and has a specific cost.

Obviously, it isn't possible to make a drink if the machine doesn't have enough resources on it. In this case, it's possible to fill the machine to have more resources.

It's also possible to take all the money from machine and check the amount of resources. When you're done, you can just exit the menu.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

It was made with [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and is not possible to ensure that it would work in any other version.

### Installing

You can clone this repository with the command below: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaopedroimamura/coffee-machine.git
```

### Running

Then, you need to compile the Java file with:

```

Finally, run the compiled file:
